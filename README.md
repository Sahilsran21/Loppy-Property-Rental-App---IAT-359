# Loppy-Property-Rental-App---IAT-359
This repo is a continuation of a group project from IAT 359 - Mobile Computing. The previous repo wasn't utilized effectively, as it involved one person making commits in the form of ZIP copies of the project. Thus, I have decided to create a new repo all together for the purpose of legibility. 

Commit of Dec 18, 2022 contains the final project file where each team member roughly contributed as follows:

Sahil Sran - Mobile UI layout and interaction buttons
Joey Liu - Database connectivity via Google Firebase
Chongyuan Bian - Map screen functionality and zoom button
